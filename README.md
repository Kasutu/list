1. Java's Queue interface provides a first-in-first-out (to not complicate things) data structure. LinkedList implements Queue, but not ArrayList. Why would this be the case?

	- Queue provide a more memory efficient way of storing or buffering data. its advantages is it dosnt have to wait for available space in order to insert data it shifts it and deletes the data on exit in the linked list.

2. If you have to clone PvZ for a future hobby project, and you put the zombies in a list, would it be a linked list or an array list.  Why?

	- It would be a linked list, beacause the zombies can be deleted in the linked list when they are dead, so that my pc memory wont fill up with nulls.

2.5. Would your reasoning be the same if there's a game mode where the number of zombies have no limit, and you have to defend/survive for as long as you can?

	- yes, because the machine can save tons of resouurces.
